# amp-scala-thin
Scala thin client for com.scaledinference.amp_v2.Amp

Two example files to illustrate usage of the api are provided.

<b>AmpSingleSession.scala</b>

This creates an amp object, a session object and makes a single call.
The objects are created with default values and use only the required parameters (such as the project Key for the amp object) to successfully create them.
